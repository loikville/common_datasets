R.&quot; McMaster (born <TIMEX2 VAL=\"19620724\">July 24, 1962</TIMEX2>) is a United States Army lieutenant general and the incoming National Security Advisor to United States President Donald Trump.', 'His current military assignment is Director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, and Deputy Commanding General, Futures, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command.', '<br> <br>McMaster&#39;s prior assignments include Commanding General, Ft. Benning Maneuver Center of Excellence, and Director of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force-Shafafiyat at the International Security Assistance Force Headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan.', 'He is known for his roles in the Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.', 'McMaster authored the book Dereliction of Duty in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1997\">1997</TIMEX2>, which criticized the actions of high ranking U.S. military leadership during the Vietnam War.', '<br> <br>Early life and education [ edit ] <br> <br>McMaster was born in Philadelphia on <TIMEX2 VAL=\"19620724\">July 24, 1962</TIMEX2>.', '[1] He went to high school at Valley Forge Military Academy, graduating in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1980\">1980</TIMEX2>.', 'He earned a commission as a second lieutenant upon graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1984\">1984</TIMEX2>.', 'McMaster earned a Master of Arts and Ph.D. in American history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).', 'His thesis was critical of American strategy in the Vietnam War, which was further detailed in his <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1997\">1997</TIMEX2> book Dereliction of Duty.', '[2] <br> <br>Dereliction of Duty (book) [ edit ] <br> <br>Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, The Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies that Led to Vietnam is a book written by McMaster that explores the military&#39;s role in the policies of the Vietnam War.', 'The book was written as part of his Ph.D. dissertation at UNC.', 'It harshly criticized high-ranking officers of that era, arguing that they inadequately challenged Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and President Lyndon Johnson on their Vietnam strategy.', 'The book examines McNamara and Johnson&#39;s staff alongside the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other high ranking military officers, and their failure to provide a successful plan of action either to pacify a Viet Cong insurgency or to decisively defeat the North Vietnamese Army.', 'McMaster also details why military actions intended to indicate &quot;resolve&quot; or to &quot;communicate&quot; ultimately failed when trying to accomplish sparsely detailed, confusing, and conflicting military objectives.', 'The book was widely read in Pentagon circles and included in military reading lists.', '<br> <br>Military Career [ edit ] <br> <br>His first assignment after commissioning was to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, where he served in a variety of platoon and company level leadership assignments with 1st Battalion 66th Armor Regiment.', 'In <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1989\">1989</TIMEX2>, McMaster was assigned to the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany, where he served until <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1992\">1992</TIMEX2>, including deployment to Operation Desert Storm.', '<br> <br>During the Gulf War in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1991\">1991</TIMEX2> he was a captain commanding Eagle Troop of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of 73 Easting.', '[3] During that battle, though significantly outnumbered and encountering the enemy by surprise as McMaster&#39;s lead tank crested a dip in the terrain, the nine tanks of Eagle Troop destroyed over eighty Iraqi Republican Guard tanks and other vehicles without loss, due to the Abrams tank being state-of-the-art armored technology while the Iraqi equipment included grossly outdated T-62s and T-72s of the Soviet era as well as similarly dated Type 69s of Chinese manufacture.', '[4] <br> <br>McMaster was awarded the Silver Star.', 'The battle features in several books about Desert Storm and is widely referred to in US Army training exercises.', 'It also receives coverage in Tom Clancy&#39;s <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1994\">1994</TIMEX2> popular non-fiction book Armored Cav.', '[4] McMaster served as a military history professor at West Point from <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1994TO1996\">1994 to 1996</TIMEX2>, teaching among other things the battles in which he fought.', 'He graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1999\">1999</TIMEX2>.', '[5] <br> <br>From <TIMEX2 VAL=\"1999TO2002\">1999 to 2002</TIMEX2>, McMaster commanded 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, and then took a series of staff positions at U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), including planning and operations roles in Iraq.', '<br> <br>In his next job, as lieutenant colonel and later colonel, McMaster worked on the staff of USCENTCOM as executive officer to Deputy Commander Lieutenant General John Abizaid.', 'When Abizaid received four-star rank and became Central Command&#39;s head, McMaster served as Director, Commander&#39;s Advisory Group (CAG), described as the command&#39;s brain trust.', '<br> <br>In 2003 McMaster completed an Army War College research fellowship at Stanford University&#39;s Hoover Institution.', '<br> <br>In <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2004\">2004</TIMEX2>, he was assigned to command the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (3rd ACR).', 'Shortly after McMaster took command the regiment deployed for its second tour in Iraq and was assigned the mission of securing the city of Tal Afar.', 'That mission culminated in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201609\">September</TIMEX2> with Operation Restoring Rights and the defeat of the city&#39;s insurgent strongholds.', 'President Bush praised this success, and the PBS show Frontline broadcast a documentary in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"200602\">February 2006</TIMEX2> featuring interviews with McMaster.', 'CBS&#39; <TIMEX2 VAL=\"PT60M\">60 Minutes</TIMEX2> produced a similar segment in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201607\">July</TIMEX2>,[6] and the operation was the subject of an article in the <TIMEX2 VAL=\"20060410\">April 10, 2006</TIMEX2>, issue of The New Yorker.', '<br> <br>Author Tim Harford has written that the pioneering tactics employed by 3rd ACR led to the first success in overcoming the Iraqi insurgency.', 'Prior to <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2005\">2005</TIMEX2>, tactics included staying out of dangerous urban areas except on patrols, with US forces returning to their bases each night.', 'These patrols had little success in turning back the insurgency because local Iraqis who feared retaliation would very rarely assist in identifying them to US forces.', 'McMaster deployed his soldiers into Tal Afar on a permanent basis, and once the local population grew confident that they weren&#39;t going to withdraw <TIMEX2 VAL=\"P1D\">nightly</TIMEX2>, the citizens began providing information on the insurgents, enabling US forces to target and defeat them.', '[4][7] <br> <br>McMaster passed command of the 3rd ACR on <TIMEX2 VAL=\"20060629\">June 29, 2006</TIMEX2> and joined the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, as a Senior Research Associate with a mandate described as &quot;conduct[ing] research to identify opportunities for improved multi-national cooperation and political-military integration in the areas of counterinsurgency, counter-terrorism, and state building&quot;, and to devise &quot;better tactics to battle terrorism.&quot;[8] <br> <br>From <TIMEX2 VAL=\"200708\">August 2007</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 VAL=\"200808\">August 2008</TIMEX2> McMaster was part of an &quot;elite team of officers advising US commander&quot; General David Petraeus on counterinsurgency operations while Petraeus directed revision of the Army&#39;s Counterinsurgency Field Manual during his command of the Combined Arms Center.', '[9] Petraeus and most of his team were stationed in Fort Leavenworth at the time but McMaster collaborated remotely, according to senior team member John Nagl.', '[4][7] <br> <br>McMaster was passed over for promotion to Brigadier General in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2006\">2006</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2007\">2007</TIMEX2>, despite his reputation as one of &quot;the most celebrated soldiers of the Iraq War.&quot;[10] Though the Army&#39;s rationale for whether a given officer is selected or not selected is not made public, McMaster&#39;s initial non-selection attracted media attention.', '[11][12][13] However, in late <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2007\">2007</TIMEX2>, Secretary of the Army Pete Geren requested General David Petraeus to return from Iraq to take charge of the promotion board as a way to ensure that the best performers in combat received every consideration for advancement, resulting in McMaster&#39;s selection along with other Colonels who had been identified as innovative thinkers.', '[4][14] McMaster&#39;s name was subsequently released on the promotion list for Brigadier General in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2008\">2008</TIMEX2>.', '[12] <br> <br>In <TIMEX2 VAL=\"200808\">August 2008</TIMEX2>, McMaster assumed duties as Director, Concept Development and Experimentation (later renamed Concept Development and Learning), in the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) at Fort Monroe, Virginia, part of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command.', 'In this position McMaster was involved in preparing doctrine to guide the Army over the next ten to <TIMEX2 VAL=\"P20Y\">twenty years</TIMEX2>.', 'He was promoted on <TIMEX2 VAL=\"20090629\">June 29, 2009</TIMEX2>.', '[15] In <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201007\">July 2010</TIMEX2> he was selected to be the J-5, Deputy to the Commander for Planning, at ISAF (International Security Assistance Forces) Headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan.', 'Additionally, McMaster directed a joint anti-corruption task force (CJIATF-Shafafiyat) at ISAF Headquarters.', '[citation needed] <br> <br>McMaster as commander of the Maneuver Center of Excellence in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2012\">2012</TIMEX2>.', '<br> <br>McMaster was nominated for Major General on <TIMEX2 VAL=\"20120123\">January 23, 2012</TIMEX2> and selected to be the commander of the Army&#39;s Maneuver Center of Excellence at Ft.', 'Benning.', '[16] McMaster took the position in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201206\">June 2012</TIMEX2> and was promoted accordingly on <TIMEX2 VAL=\"20120802\">August 2, 2012</TIMEX2>.', '[citation needed] In <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201402\">February 2014</TIMEX2>, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel nominated McMaster for Lieutenant General and in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201407\">July 2014</TIMEX2>, McMaster pinned on his third star when he began his duties as Deputy Commanding General of the Training and Doctrine Command and Director of TRADOC&#39;s Army Capabilities Integration Center.', '[17] <br> <br>Army Chief of Staff General Martin Dempsey remarked in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"2011\">2011</TIMEX2> that McMaster was &quot;probably our best Brigadier General.&quot;[18] McMaster made Time&#39;s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in <TIMEX2 VAL=\"201404\">April 2014</TIMEX2>.', 'He was hailed as &quot;the architect of <TIMEX2 VAL=\"FUTURE_REF\">the future</TIMEX2> U.S. Army&quot;
