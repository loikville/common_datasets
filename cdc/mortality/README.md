This directory contains data about causes of death by year from 1981 to 2010 from the US Centers for Disease Control.

 * The file `mortality_underyling_cause_by_years_original.csv` contains the original data downloaded from the [Health Data Interactive Site](http://205.207.175.93/hdi/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P,21). 
 * The file `mortality_underyling_cause_by_years.csv` contains the cleaned version. The original downloaded file is not valid CSV, and was modified to reflect the table shown in the Web interface by Curran Kelleher on 2/12/2014.
 * The file `mortality_underyling_cause_by_years_simplified.csv` contains the cleaned version with subcategories of causes removed (the causes that were indented with leading spaces originally).
 * The file `mortality.js` contains the AMD module generated by running `node csvToJS.js`, which parses `mortality_underyling_cause_by_years_simplified.csv` and pivoting the table such that each entry contains data for a single year and all causes.
 * The file `mortality_full.js` contains the AMD module generated by running `node csvToJS_full.js`, which parses `mortality_underyling_cause_by_years.csv`, unindenting the Cause field for each entry, and pivoting the table such that each entry contains data for a single year and all causes.
 * The `hierarchy` subdirectory contains a data module with only the cause of disease hierarchy as a D3-compatible tree data structure.
