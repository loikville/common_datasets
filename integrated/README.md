This data set combines [population data from the United Nations](https://github.com/curran/udc-data/tree/master/united_nations/world_population_prospects_2012) with [Gross Domestic Product data from the World Bank](https://github.com/curran/udc-data/tree/master/world_bank/world_development_indicators/provenance). These two data sets were integrated in [a proof of concept demo](https://github.com/curran/examples/tree/gh-pages/countriesScatter/head) for the [Universal Data Cube](https://github.com/curran/phd).
