The data behind the New York Times article [The Facebook Offering: How It Compares](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html?_r=0). The data was extracted from the page source (it was included as JSON directly in the HTML source code), then converted to CSV.

It looks like the column "rMVOP" represents the IPO value in millions of US dollars. This is based on the fact that in the NYT graphic, if you hover over the Google bubble, it says "Value at I. P. O. $28 Billion", and the value for "rMVMP" for Google is 27706.9.
