This dataset contains the number of people lynched by US State and Race between 1882 and 1968. The original data comes from [the Archives at Tuskegee Institute](http://192.203.127.197/archive/handle/123456789/507).

This data was extracted from the HTML tables published as part of the project [The Shipp Trial: An Account by Douglas Linder](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/shipp.html). Within this project, the following data tables are published:

 * [Lynching Statistics, by State and Race](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchstats.html)
 * [Lynching Statistics, by Year](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingyear.html)
 * [Lynching Statistics, by Supposed Offense](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/Lynchcauses.html)
