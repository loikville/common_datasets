This directory contains all tables from the [UNDP Human Development Reports "Exporting the data and understanding the API" Page](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/exporting-data-and-understanding-api). Each table listed was clicked, then the option "Export as CSV" was used to export each CSV file.

Data from this source was used to create the visualizations in the report [A NEW GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP: ERADICATE POVERTY AND TRANSFORM ECONOMIES THROUGH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT](http://www.post2015hlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UN-Report.pdf).
